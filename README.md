# ChartApp

This is a web application created with angular materials. It allows a user to add Todo-items and groceries. It also provides options
to mark items as done/ not-done, and to delete. The items are stored in a database through http requests made to a restfull webservice I created. There is a seperate repository for the back end of this application. I have deployed this application on Heroku:

https://sema-todolist.herokuapp.com/
